    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Khichuri is one of those rare dishes that effortlessly strides the boundary between 
        what’s considered ‘ordinary’ and ‘special’ when it comes to cooking.

        If there is one common thread linking the varied and multitudinous South Asian 
        cuisines, it is khichuri. Essentially a porridge of rice and dal tempered with a 
        handful of spices (that can vary from region to region), khichuri can be as plain
         or as rich as you want it to be. It ranges from the mild, runny, and carefully 
         spiced version for when you are under the weather, to the steaming and slurpy 
         one for those wistful rainy days, to the thick, gorgeous, ghee-laden offering 
         made to your favourite goddesses during pujo.
        
        Today’s recipe can double as an easy bhog’er khichuri, as well as a delicious, 
        sustaining rainy-day meal. It is made with shona moong—little grains of golden
         moong dal commonly found in Bengal. The rice used is gobindobhog chaal, a scented,
          short-grained variety with which polao and payesh are also typically made.

            Wasn't it so easy to cook the popular Bengali dish? I wonder why the government 
            officials are going that far spending public money to learn it!
